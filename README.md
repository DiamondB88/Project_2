### Technical Challenges

The challenges I faced for this app was the flow of signing in and comparing to log in to see if user existed. I also tried several if statements to try and add an anonymous author if no author was ever added. I still cannot figure that one out.

### Future Improvements

I would like to add a full user CRUD, where users can add profile pictures, account settings, see their recipes they have posted, as well as click on other users and see their post they have posted all on the user profile page. I want to add a search bar where users can search for certain keywords, or themes or ingredients and recipes will show up based on their input. In the future I want a categories list where recipes are also sorted out by dinner, breakfast, sweets, and drinks. I would like to add more details to styling as well.
